              <p class="text">This logo is <strong>the winner</strong> of logo competition held by the CRAFT organization <strong>the biggest Centre for Microfluidic Systems in Chemistry & Biology in Canada</strong>.
                It is a centre for Research and Applications in Fluidic Technologies and is operated by Toronto University and NRC organization. In my logo, I considered three indicators to show all of these features.
                First, I used the blue and red color to represent the Toronto University, NRC and Canada respectively.
               Second, all the letters excluding the letter of “C” are joined to figure the micro-fluidics channels that is
               the most important feature of my logo which shows the field of research in the CRAFT.
               Third, the maple leaf is exclusively showing that the CRAFT is a Canadian organization. Finally,in the design of this logo
               my sister and her friend (Fatemeh Ahmadi and Mohammad Simchi) helped me a lot and I like to thank them here.  </p>

              <div class="paragh">
                <p class="text">  EERIC is an academic, non-profit organization and aims to "promote the technical
                  competency of earthquake engineering principles to their members and Concordia University students"(EERIC Team). The logo should reflect the devastating impact of earthquakes on human life
                 and how earthquake engineering is trying to inspire hope and save lives. Given this discription, three notable points were considered to design the EERIC logo.
               considered. </p>
               <p class="text" style="margin-top: -7%;"><br>First, the two colors of blue and yellow represent the concept of help and vulnerable ground respectively. Second, the two wavy lines on top of the word EERIC shapes the symbol of help in which one hand is going to get the other one.(The top right hand is the representative of this organization and the lower one is a representative of people and their lives that are in danger of earthquake.)
                 Second, the color has turned to blue gradually to show the hope that EERIC institution is trying to inspire and how positively they want to influence people's life and their safety. Lastly, the first "E" has cracks to show damaged ground by earthquake.

              <p class="text" style="color:#B6B7B8;">Atlas is an app that can track items, people and pets. It can be used by:</p>
              <ol class="text" style="margin-top: -5%; padding-left: 28px; color: #B6B7B8;">
                <li>Normal users to detect items such as wallet/keys/bags and purses.</li>
                <li>Kindergarten teachers keep track of children on outings</li>
                <li>Pet owners to keep track of their pets</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="text" style="margin-top: -5%; width: 90%; color: #B6B7B8;"> In design of this logo I have considered two important points.
                First, As the logo is going to be used as an app Icon, it should be kept simple. Therefore, I Decided to avoid adding any extra details and instead  to use the negative space of my
                logo properly . That is, I put the first letter of ATLAS at the center of map symbol to remind the users the app name rather than putting the whole word of ATLAS in my design.
                Second, in order to gain users trust at the first sight, I used green color as the logo main color. The green color most of the time conveys the
                concept of safty to people's mind.</p>

              <p class="text">  "The Loyola Committee is under ASFA and is a conglomeration of all MA’s on the Loyola Campus. This Loyola Committee
                 was created to ease cooperation between MA’s on the Loyola Campus. The Loyola Committee’s goal is to make student’s discover the
                 Loyola Campus and facilitate socialization between students on their campus." (Victoria Videira)<br><br>In fact, the second part of this committee goal is the
                 boldest feature that can be used to design the logo. Using one of the Concordia University logos, first, I showed the Loyola committee belongs to the Concordia University.
                 Second, I manipulated the letter of “C” to indicate socialization between students and how the committee’s help and support can strengthen it. </p>
