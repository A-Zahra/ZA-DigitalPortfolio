          <p class="text">In the 2019 logo competition held by the CRAFT organization<strong>the most important Centre for Microfluidic Systems in Chemistry & Biology in Canada</strong>, my logo
            design was selected to represent the organization. CRAFT is a centre for Research
            and Applications in Fluidic Technologies and is operated by the Toronto University and
            NRC organization. I considered three indicators while designing the logo to show the
            features of the organization. First, I used the blue and red color to represent the Toronto
            University, NRC and Canada respectively. Secondly, all the letters, excluding the letter
            “C” are joined to figure the micro-fluidics channels that is the most important feature of
            my logo and shows the field of research in CRAFT. Thirdly, the maple leaf illustrates
            that CRAFT is a Canadian organization. </p>

          <div class="paragh">
            <p class="text">EERIC (Earthquake Engineering Research Institute-Concordia) is an academic nonprofit
              organization. The organization’s main goal is to "promote the technical
              competency of earthquake engineering principles to their members and Concordia
              University students" (Bayan Abu Safieh). The organization held a logo contest in Spring.
              Among the participants, my logo was selected as one of the four best designs to be in
              the nomination for voting.<br></p>
            <p class="text" style="margin-top: -4%;">The organization’s new logo "should reflect the devastating impact of earthquakes on
              human life, and how earthquake engineering is trying to inspire hope and save
              lives" (Bayan Abu Safieh). Using three elements, I tried to illustrate this purpose. The
              yellow and blue colours convey respectively the notion of damaged ground and hope in
              first sight. Then, the cracks on the first "E" letter pictures earthquake physical
              appearance. Finally, the two wavy lines on top of the EERIC show the concept of help
              and hope that the organization aimed to provide people with. The top right hand
              represents EERIC and the lower left one is people and their lives that are in danger of earthquake damages.</p>

          <p class="text" style="color:#B6B7B8;">Atlas is an app that can track items, people and pets.<br>It can be used by:</p>
          <ol class="text" style="margin-top: -5%; padding-left: 28px; color: #B6B7B8; text-indent: 0px;">
            <li>Normal users to detect items such as wallet, keys, bags <br>& purses.</li>
            <li>Kindergarten teachers keep track of children on outings</li>
            <li>Pet owners to keep track of their pets</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text" style="margin-top: -5%; width: 90%; color: #B6B7B8;"> While designing the logo, 
            I considered two important factors: the simplicity of the logo
            for app design and the use of negative space to enhance the logo. I put the first letter of
            ATLAS at the centre of map symbol to remind the users of the app name. Secondly, in
            order to gain the users trust at the first sight, I used green colour as the logo’s primary colour.</p>

          <p class="text">"The Loyola Committee is one of the subsidiaries of ASFA organization. It is a
            conglomeration of all MA’s and it was created to ease cooperation between MA’s in
            Loyola Campus. The Loyola Committee’s goal is to make student’s discover the Loyola
            Campus and facilitates socialization between students on their campus." (Victoria Videira)<br></p>
          <p class="text" style="margin-top: -2%;">In fact, the second part of this committee goal is the boldest feature that could be used
            to design their logo. Using one of the Concordia University logos, first, I showed the
            Loyola committee belongs to Concordia University. Secondly, I modified the shape of
            the letter “C” to showcase the socialization between students and the committee who
            are helpful and supportive.</p>
