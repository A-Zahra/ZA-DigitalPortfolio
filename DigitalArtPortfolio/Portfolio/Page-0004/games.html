      <h3 class="Heading">Winner of CRAFT logo competition!</h3>
      <p class="text">In the 2019 logo competition held by the CRAFT organization<strong>the most important Centre for Microfluidic Systems in Chemistry & Biology in Canada</strong>, my logo
        design was selected to represent the organization. CRAFT is a centre for Research
        and Applications in Fluidic Technologies and is operated by the Toronto University and
        NRC organization. I considered three indicators while designing the logo to show the
        features of the organization. First, I used the blue and red color to represent the Toronto
        University, NRC and Canada respectively. Secondly, all the letters, excluding the letter
        “C” are joined to figure the micro-fluidics channels that is the most important feature of
        my logo and shows the field of research in CRAFT. Thirdly, the maple leaf illustrates
        that CRAFT is a Canadian organization. </p>
