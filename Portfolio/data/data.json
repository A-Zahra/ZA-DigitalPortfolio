          "brief": "This puzzle game has two different levels that are not complementary. The rules considered for each level are such that distinguishes them from all other puzzle games. The main goal behind this game is more to amuze the player than letting them to win in the first place. </br>In first level which is the easier one , the puzzle frame is hidden and to find puzzle pieces spots, the player should mouse over the screen. Once a piece is dropped, it no more can be replaced or moved. In second level, the player should complete the puzzle while they are answering a set of random questions. The questions pop up every few seconds and in case of giving wrong answer, next question immediately pops up. The player can win the game only if they finish the puzzle sooner than the questions are finished. (All of the images were borrowed from online resources due to time limitation)"

It consists of several main parts including introduction, instruction, game story , connecting pages, steps and screens of win or lose. The main purpose of my game is, to let the player experiences different and respective stages which all human beings experience during their life in form of game and entertainment. Just like real life that we are first trained and thought how to develop our skills in order to achieve our goals, my game gives the player same opportunity to train himself through first and second steps and then, using the developed skills, succeeds to win the last level and ends up winning the whole game!

The player should either gain all of the targets or as much as possible before their competitor dies. Meanwhile, to keep playing they should stay alive by getting energy from their 'family'. Also, once one of the players hit a barrier, the targets are hided for both. To get the targets back, one of the players should consult their 'friends'.My goal in making this game was to simulate the situation in which we humans really find ourselves in real life for the players. The main template of this game was given by my professor and I built my own ideas upon that. (All of the vector images were borrowed from online resources due to time limitation)"

The player is an owl and can move with keys, if it overlaps the (randomly moving) prey, it eats it by sucking out the prey life and adding that to its own. To stay alive, the player should keep eating the prey otherwise it dies.</br>This game has three levels and it gets harder as the game goes forward.
