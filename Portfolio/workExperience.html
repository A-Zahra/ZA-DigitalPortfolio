            <p class="proDescription">Invictus Gloves is a Canadian company which produces custom sport gloves for athletes like football players. To showcase their product, persona and
               Invictus colours on social media, they were looking for a mesmerizing and memorable loop video. </br>Being inspired by watching similar videos, I created an animation which displays all elements
               they asked for. For instance, by giving different colours and brands to the gloves in my video, I tried to show that the company produces custom gloves. Or, almost all colours used for
               the objects on the scene are black and gold or a mixture of both to make this video unique for the Invictus.
            </br>Moreover, by accomplishing this project I learnt many new technics and features of the 3D animation software I used, which makes this project an invaluable experience to me.

              <p class="proDescription">In the 2019 logo competition held by the CRAFT organization (the most important Centre for Microfluidic Systems in Chemistry & Biology in Canada),
                my logo design was selected to represent the organization. CRAFT is a centre for Research and Applications in Fluidic Technologies and is operated
                by the Toronto University and NRC organization. I considered three indicators while designing the logo to show the features of the organization.
                First, I used the blue and red colour to represent the Toronto University, NRC and Canada respectively. Secondly, all the letters excluding the
                letter “C” are joined to figure the micro-fluidics channels that is the most important feature of my logo and shows the field of research in CRAFT.
                Thirdly, the maple leaf illustrates that CRAFT is a Canadian organization.</p>

            </br>To make her bussiness card represents her carrier, I decided to use carpet patterns to design both the logo and the card itself.
              For instance, as her brand name was "Toranj" which is inspired by a famous pattern that is usually used in carpet, I desided to bring that pattern into the logo design.</p>
